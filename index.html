  <h1>Hi.</h1>

  <p>I'm Soumitra Saxena, and this here is my my tiny part of the Internet. I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_director#Film_.26_Games" target="_blank">Technical Director</a> by profession, and the hardest part of my job is explaining what I actually do. I voted for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller%27s_Day_Off" target="_blank">Ferris Bueller</a> in the last election, and believe that the world would be a better place if everyone spoke the language of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a>. If you're curious, find out more <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">about me.</a></p>

  <p> I live in the beautiful city of Paris and it has been an amazing experience so far. </p>

  <p>Do check out my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/">blog</a>, because who really knows what you might find.</p>
